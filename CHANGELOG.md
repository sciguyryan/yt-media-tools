# Changelog

## Discover 0.20.1 - Conformance Corrections

- Fix signed numeric literal resolution so negative values remain numeric after tokenisation, including scalar-function fallbacks such as `COALESCE(view_count, -1)`.
- Add comprehensive deterministic yt-sql conformance coverage for the complete current language surface and its viable edge cases.
- Add malformed-query, semantic-rejection, unit-registry and parameter-binding edge coverage.
- Keep routine semantic conformance fast through in-process production execution while retaining representative real-CLI parity checks.

## Discover 0.20.0 - Multilingual Measures

- Move duration and temporal unit names into external JSON unit-definition files.
- Load English and Welsh units through the same case-insensitive registry, including aliases and shared short forms.
- Resolve derived units recursively to fixed seconds or Gregorian calendar months, with explicit validation for cycles, unresolved references and token collisions.
- Accept Unicode unit names while preserving strict duration and date/time type rules.
- Correct the optional YouTube.js tool-check fixture to model the resolved module path reported by the bridge.

## Discover 0.19.0 - Acquisition Observability

- Resolve optional YouTube.js through the project Node environment and report the resolved module path in `--check-tools`.
- Add coarse stderr progress for lengthy source enumeration while preserving clean stdout query output.
- Emit live large-source notices when enumeration reaches `--warn-source-size`.
- Warn before very-high-cost automatic full-source plans where no safe source boundary is available.
- Refresh tests and current documentation for acquisition and tool-discovery behaviour.

## Downloader 1.6.0 - Optional Cookies

- Make cookies optional by default while continuing to use script-local `cookies.txt` automatically when present.
- Add strict `--cookies FILE` and explicit `--no-cookies` controls.
- Keep missing explicitly requested cookie files as configuration errors.
- Refresh tests and current documentation for the cookie policy.

## Repository - Test-suite organisation

- Replace historical Discover phase-based test modules with capability-oriented test modules.
- Split Downloader's catch-all behavioural tests into CLI, input-source, output-profile, queue-reconciliation and command-planning modules.
- Keep routine, scale and stress conformance tiers unchanged while making test ownership clearer for future language work.
- Expand `.gitignore` coverage for script-relative credentials, queues, caches, provenance, downloaded media and yt-dlp sidecars.
- No tool version changed.

## 0.18.1 - Tiered Testing

- Exclude large and huge conformance datasets from routine pytest and pull-request CI by default.
- Add explicit `scale` and `stress` pytest tiers for selected large-dataset and huge torture tests.
- Split cardinality and prefix-contract checks so routine tests never construct the large or huge corpora implicitly.
- Retire the golden query-dataset concept in favour of deterministic generated inputs plus the independent Python semantic oracle.
- Retain deliberately designed semantic anchor records inside the deterministic generator.
- Fix the remaining Ruff test-style finding.

## Downloader 1.5.0

- Adopt the mature downloader policy, profile-resolution and input-source architecture from the canonical implementation.
- Separate output-profile settings from global download policy through explicit `OutputProfile` and `DownloadPolicy` models.
- Formalise direct, batch-file and standard-input source handling through a single `InputSource` abstraction.
- Strengthen profile validation, archive reconciliation, completion callbacks and environment validation.
- Standardise the executable and documentation name on `yt-download.py`.

## Repository - Pre-canonical audit

- Recorded intentional version and executable-name differences from the earlier supplied endpoint.
- Added a final canonical comparison checklist covering code, documentation, tests, tooling, modes and repository hygiene.
- No tool version changed.

## Repository - Reliability and stress-test policy

- Made large and huge conformance tests opt-in through the `stress` pytest marker.
- Expanded ignore rules for runtime credentials, ID lists, generated caches and local development state.
- Added downloader test-package scaffolding for cleaner fixture sharing and import isolation.
- Pinned Ruff GitHub Actions checks and restricted workflow permissions to repository read access.
- No tool version changed.

## Discover 0.18.0

- Converged Discover on the mature typed YT-SQL parser, schema and execution model.
- Added dedicated archive, date, output, report, tool-registry, YouTube.js and yt-dlp support modules.
- Expanded acquisition planning, observability, source handling and cache semantics.
- Replaced the preliminary conformance harness with the mature deterministic generator, dataset specification and independent oracle suite.
- Kept large and huge conformance profiles available for deliberate stress runs while disabling them in the default automated suite.
- Added the current Discover and YT-SQL reference documentation.
- Downloader remains at 1.4.2.

## Repository - Executable-mode correction

- Restored executable file modes on the two shebang-bearing CLI entry points after the Phase 37 packaging workflow dropped them.
- No tool version changed.

## Repository - Conformance architecture

- Expanded the deterministic YT-SQL dataset generator to version 2.
- Added `small`, `normal`, `large` and `huge` profiles plus exact-size generation.
- Added an independent expected-result oracle and golden conformance fixtures.
- No tool version changed.

## Discover 0.17.1 / Downloader 1.4.2

- Fixed remaining Ruff E701 findings in Discover parameter coercion.
- Marked both shebang-bearing CLI scripts executable so Ruff EXE001 passes.
- No user-facing behaviour changed beyond the revision maintenance fixes.

Entries are annotated by tool or repository so the independent version lines remain clear.

## Repository - Package foundation

- Moved mature Discover support modules into `yt_media_tools`.
- Moved the YouTube.js bridge beside the packaged source backend.
