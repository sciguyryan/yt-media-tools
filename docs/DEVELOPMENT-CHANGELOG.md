# Development changelog

This file records meaningful changes during active development. It is not release history. When a dot release is completed and accepted, relevant entries are reconciled into the root `CHANGELOG.md` and the completed development section is cleared or advanced for the next work item.

## Discover 0.29.x - Unreleased

- [docs] Audit identifier case sensitivity, contextual and reserved keywords, Unicode identifier behaviour, quoted identifiers, structured members and raw backend-key access.
- [docs] Identify case-folded identifier resolution, the implementation-defined Unicode identifier grammar and missing backtick-quoted identifiers as dependencies before the identifier and keyword contract can be frozen.

## Downloader 1.19.x - Unreleased

- [feature] Add `--remove-completed-rows` for annotated file-backed queues whose first whitespace-delimited field is the download target.
- [maintenance] Preserve the exact-line semantics of `--remove-completed-ids` while sharing archive reconciliation and queue reporting with annotated-row removal.
- [test] Add deterministic annotated-row parsing, atomic removal, archive reconciliation and command-planning coverage.
